  <h1>ü™®‚úÇÔ∏èüìÑ Rock Paper Scissors Game ‚Äì Evolution of Implementation</h1>

  <p>
    This repository contains <strong>8 different implementations</strong> of the classic 
    <strong>Rock-Paper-Scissors</strong> game, each showcasing a variety of 
    <strong>methods, libraries</strong>, and <strong>approaches</strong> to solve the same problem.
    The project evolves from basic script-style coding to the most <strong>optimized and modular</strong> version in <code>File 8</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're a beginner learning Python or someone interested in comparing coding styles,
    this repository offers a hands-on look at <strong>progressive improvements and optimization techniques</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>üìÅ File Overview</h2>
  <p>Each file represents a unique version of the game with different techniques or features introduced. Below is a comparison table:</p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>rock_paper_scissor_5.py</code></td>
        <td>Added closures along with scope which helps to keep track of games played and who won how many games which gives us the final winner if multiple rounds are played.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>rock_paper_scissor_6.py</code></td>
        <td>Implemented f-strings for better readability and ease of use</td>

      <tr>
        <td><code>rock_paper_scissor_7.py</code></td>
        <td>Converted our game file to a module file so that it can be used further by other files.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>rock_paper_scissor_8.py</code></td>
        <td>Uses command line arguments and personalizes the game using name as the argument</td>

  <h2>‚úÖ How to Run</h2>
  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock_paper_scissors.git
cd rock_paper_scissors
python rock_paper_scissor_1.py  # or any version you want to run
</code></pre>

  <h2>üí° Why This Project?</h2>
  <p>
    This repository demonstrates how a simple game can evolve through thoughtful refactoring,
    better design choices, and the use of Python features. It is a great resource to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Practice clean code principles</li>
    <li>Learn the transition from procedural to object-oriented programming</li>
    <li>Understand the importance of code modularity and optimization</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìå Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    File 8 is the <strong>most optimized and extensible version</strong>, suitable for further enhancements like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>GUI-based gameplay</li>
    <li>Multiplayer over network</li>
    <li>Adding more elements (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Feel free to fork and build upon it!</p>
